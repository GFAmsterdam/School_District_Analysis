# School District Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis: 
The purpose of this analysis is to take a deeper look at school performances in the district at the school and student level. Particularly with math and reading scores and passing percentages. In this analysis, we have excluded the 9th grade scores from Thomas High School as there was some question as to the corruption of these scores. These grades were shown as NaN instead of "0" so as not to corrupt the efforts of the other students at Thomas High School and the district overall.  

## Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.

### How is the district summary affected?
